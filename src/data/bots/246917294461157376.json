      "page": "Looking for a well-rounded bot that can do almost anything? Cat may be able to fulfill your needs.\r\n\r\nSome of the features included:\r\n\r\n* High-quality audio player with a custom playlist system (YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify, Twitch, Shoutcast/Icy/http streams, Mixer, Vimeo, Bandcamp...)\r\n* Level based system with user-customizable profile cards, also has level-based role application and removal\r\n* RPG-style Adventure game\r\n* Casino games with a global economy system\r\n* Mod tools\r\n* Starboard\r\n* Custom image-based welcome messages for new members\r\n* A watching system for your server that reports when anything changes (server joins, leaves, role changes, message deletions or edits)\r\n* Reaction-based raffle/giveaway\r\n* NSFW image commands\r\n* and much more as new commands are added frequently...\r\n\r\nCat is based on Red-DiscordBot's new rewrite. I welcome feedback as I am the dev for the audio module. Requests for new features are also welcomed (but will take a back seat to new audio improvements being written first).\r\n\r\nCat will never cost money to use and will have as close to a 100% uptime as possible.\r\n\r\nUse c!help to get started once you've invited him. You can also set your own prefix for the bot with the c!set serverprefix command."

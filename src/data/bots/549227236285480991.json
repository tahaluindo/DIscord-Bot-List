      "page": "Lit bot was one of my first bot that I made on discord and only had a few commands. \r\nIt got very outdated since I stoped working on it. \r\nBut now I am back with a remake of lit bot, you could call it lit bot 2.0 if you want to! \r\nIt now has over 30 commands and will be getting a lot more every update. \r\nIf you want to know what the bot can do type lb.help in a channel with the bot! \r\nAs for now this is all I can tell you so have fun with lit bot!\r\n\r\nMade by: Gaming Frame, Skyhawk and Arno Keesmand"

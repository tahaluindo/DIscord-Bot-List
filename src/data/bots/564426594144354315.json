Users can submit suggestions, and server staff members with the customizable staff role can approve or deny them, making sure only valid suggestions make it out to users for voting.\r\n\r\n- Inviting the bot\r\nInviting Suggester is easy! Go to https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=564426594144354315&scope=bot&permissions=67497025 to add it to your server! The bot requires all permissions there, or else it will not work correctly.\r\n\r\n- Features\r\nSuggester has two different suggestion handling modes: \"review\" and \"autoapprove\". The \"review\" mode will hold all submitted suggestions for staff review, and the \"autoapprove\" mode will automatically send every suggestion to the suggestions feed.\r\n\r\nOnce a suggestion has been approved, it can be commented on, marked as having a certain status (ex. done), and have an attachment added. You can read more about the bot and its features at https://suggester.gitbook.io/docs/\r\n\r\n-Support\r\nIf you have any questions about the bot or need assistance, you can head over to our Support Server (https://discord.gg/a3NuakW) and our team will be more than happy to help!"

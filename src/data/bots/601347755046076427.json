Once everybody leaves this new channel - it gets deleted.\r\n\r\nThe bot will keep new channels in the same category as the lobby and will enable same user limits as the lobby.\r\n\r\n[Here's how it looks](https://i.imgur.com/xNKVC2B.mp4)\r\n\r\nList of available commands:\r\n- help (or empty mention) - shows help message\r\n- register [voice_chat_id OR voice_chat_name] - registers a voice chat that will be used as a lobby\r\n- unregister [voice_chat_id OR voice_chat_name] - unregisters an existing lobby\r\n- id [voice_chat_name OR category_name] - use this to learn ids of voice channels by name or category\r\n- list - lists all registered lobbies and how many new channels exist\r\n- stats - take a sneak peek on bot's performance!\r\n- support - sends an invite to support Discord server"
